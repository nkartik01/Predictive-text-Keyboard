# Predictive-text-Keyboard
This is a Python-Kivy framework based Application compiled  into a .exe file folder to make it independent of the python compiler and package installations.

Requirements:
  1. Windows OS
  2. Xampp (or other equivalent) MySQL  Database server.

The source code is available in the following files:
  1. main.py
  2. main1.py
  3. search.kv

Put these files in the same folder and you will be able to run it in any usual pyhton compiler given you have all the required packages installed in your machine.

As this is a Kivy based Application, it can and actually is made to run on any android device with 'mariadb server' and python compiler(Pydroid,Kivy-launcher etc are available on play store).

It can also be packaged into an installable .apk file using Buildozer VM.

To Run, Start the xampp server and run the 'keyboard.exe' file.
